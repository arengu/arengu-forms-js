## Getting started
To get started, paste this snippet into the `head` tag of your website:

```html
<script async src="https://sdk.arengu.com/forms.js"></script>
```

This snippet will load our JavaScript SDK into your website asynchronously, so it won’t affect your website load speed.

## Embed a form

Specify where you want to embed our form using any of the following techniques.

### Method 1: Using a HTML tag (Recommended)
Place the following HTML tag where you want your form to appear:

```html
<div data-arengu-form-id="YOUR_FORM_ID"></div>
```

You have to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your **Form ID**, which you can find in your form settings or share page.

You can place **multiple HTML tags** on the same page, our SDK will detect all tags with `data-arengu-form-id` attribute and embed the forms inside them.

You can populate field or hidden field values to your form using URL parameters or `data-field-fieldId` attribute (where `fieldId` has to be replaced with its real identifier).

Example using URL parameters for `code` field:

```
https://www.acme.com/?code=ABC123
```

Example using custom attribute for `code` field:

```html
<div data-arengu-form-id="YOUR_FORM_ID" data-field-code="ABC123"></div>
```

### Method 2: Calling our `embed` method

Our SDK has an embed method that allows to embed your form inside any element.

`embed` method definition:
```
ArenguForms.embed(formId, selector);
```
The `embed` call has the following fields:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| formId _(required)_| [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | The **Form ID** of your form. You can find it in your form settings or share page. |
| selector _(required)_ | [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)\|[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) | Query selector or DOM element that the form will be appended to. |
| customValues _(optional)_ | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) | Object id-value pair to populate field or hidden field values. |

Example using the query selector:

```javascript
ArenguForms.embed('5073697614331904', '.form-container');
```

Example using the query selector and populated values:

```javascript
ArenguForms.embed('5073697614331904', '.form-container', {
  userId: '123456',
  email: 'jane.doe@arengu.com'
});
```

That snippet will embed the form with ID `5073697614331904` into the element with `.form-container` class.

Another example using the element directly:

```javascript
const container = document.querySelector('.form-container');
ArenguForms.embed('5073697614331904', container);
```

In this case, the snippet gets a reference to the element and passes it directly to the `embed()` method.

## Style customization
The look and feel of ours forms can be personalized to use your branding colors and share the same design when they are embedded into your website.

These configuration can be modified while you preview the result in our forms editor.
1. Log into Arengu
1. Go to Forms module.
1. Edit the corresponding form.
1. Go to Design panel.
1. Edit the theme.

Based on your choice, the SDK will calculate automatically the rest of settings.

### Advanced personalization

Sometimes, the calculated style do not satisfy the branding requirements. For those cases, our SDK allows you to override the calculated look and feel.

We do not want you to define tens of CSS rules and selectors, so we have defined a list of variables that you can define and our SDK uses automatically.

* Backgrounds: `primary-color`, `boolean-background-color`, `dropdown-icon-color`, `dropdown-background-color`, `dropdown-option-background-color`, `dropdown-option-hover-background-color`, `message-success-background-color`
* Paddings: `input-padding`, `dropdown-padding`, `password-padding`, `payment-input-padding`, `button-padding`
* Borders:
  * Style: `input-border`,
  * Color: `border-focus-color`
  * Radius: `input-border-radius`, `checkbox-border-radius`, `button-border-radius`, `message-border-radius`
* Sizes: `input-height`
* Fonts:
  * Sizes: `font-size`, `input-font-size`, `label-font-size`, `counter-font-size`, `hint-font-size`, `button-font-size`, `field-error-font-size`, `message-fail-font-size`
  * Colors: `font-color`, `primary-font-color`, `field-error-font-color`, `label-required-color`
  * Family: `font-family`
  * Weights: `label-font-weight`, `button-font-weight`

You can define those variables using the generic CSS selector `.af-form`. For example:

```
.af-form {
  --primary-color: #20C997;
  --font-size: '16px';
}
```

If you want to define different styles for multiple forms, a more specific CSS selector `.af-form-FORMID` is available. For example:

```
.af-form-159308471972087980 {
  --primary-color: #20C997;
}

.af-form-5639313064722432 {
  --primary-color: #15798F;
}
```

## Custom DOM events

Our SDK provides several types of custom DOM events. You can utilize the events within your JavaScript code to run a function in a specific situation. These events are particularly useful for analytics purposes.

### List of custom DOM events:

| Event | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `af-init` | Fires when the SDK initializes successfully.|
| `af-getForm` | Fires when requesting a form.|
| `af-getForm-success` | Fires when successfully getting a form.|
| `af-getForm-error` | Fires when there is an error trying to get a form.|
| `af-embedForm` | Fires when starting to embed a form.|
| `af-embedForm-error` | Fires when there is an error embedding a form.|
| `af-embedForm-success` | Fires when a form is successfully embed.|
| `af-previousStep` | Fires when going to the previous form step.|
| `af-nextStep` | Fires when continuing to the next form step.|
| `af-submitForm` | Fires when a form is submitted, regardless of the result.|
| `af-submitForm-error` | Fires when there is an error submitting a form.|
| `af-submitForm-success` | Fires when a form is submitted successfully.|
| `af-invalidFields-error` | Fires when there are invalid fields. |
| `af-blurField` | Fires when a field loses focus |
| `af-focusField` | Fires when a field gets focus |
| `af-changeField` | Fires when the value of a field has been changed. |

Example listening an event and printing a message:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('af-submitForm-success', function() {
  analytics.track('formSubmit');
});
```

All these events pass data to the event handler as `detail` property.

### List of available properties of the event object:

| Property | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `detail.formId` | The ID of the form. |
| `detail.confirmation.id` | The ID of the submission. |
| `detail.fielId` | The ID of the field. |
| `detail.value` | The value of the field. |
| `detail.current` | The ID of the current step. |
| `detail.next` | The ID of the next step. |
| `detail.previous` | The ID of the previous  step |
| `detail.formData` | The submitted form fields data. |
| `detail.metaData` | The submitted form meta data. |

Example listening an event and using `detail` property to send analytics data:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('af-submitForm-success', function(e) {
  analytics.track('formSubmit', {
    formId: e.detail.formId
  });
});
```

## Browser compatibility

Our SDK is built for two different targets: modern browsers and legacy ones. The CDN automatically delivers the right one in function of the `User-Agent` header specified in the request.

The following table specifies the minimum version supported by each target:

| Browser | Standard | Legacy |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Google Chrome | >= 55 (Dec 2016) | >= 40 (Jan 2015)
| Mozilla Firefox | >= 53 (Apr 2017) | >= 40 (Aug 2015)
| Safari (Desktop) | >= 11 (Sept 2017) | >= 10 (Sept 2016)
| Safari (iOS) | >= 11 (Sept 2017) | >= 10 (Sept 2016)
| Microsoft Edge (EdgeHTML) | >= 17 (Apr 2018) | >= 13 (Sept 2015)
| Opera | >= 42 (Dec 2016) | >= 33 (Oct 2015)
| Internet Explorer | None | >= 11 (Oct 2013)
