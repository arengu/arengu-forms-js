# Arengu Forms JavaScript SDK
Embed our forms easily into your website with our JavaScript SDK.

## Getting started
To get started, paste this snippet into the `head` tag of your website:

```html
<script async src="https://sdk.arengu.com/forms.js"></script>
```

This snippet will load our JavaScript SDK into your website asynchronously, so it wonâ€™t affect your website load speed.

Specify where you want to embed our form using any of the following techniques.

### **Method 1: Using a HTML tag** (Recommended)
Place the following HTML tag where you want your form to appear:

```html
<div data-arengu-form-id="YOUR_FORM_ID"></div>
```

You have to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your **Form ID**, which you can find in your form settings or share page.

You can place **multiple HTML tags** on the same page, our SDK will detect all tags with `data-arengu-form-id` attribute and embed the forms inside them.

You can populate field or hidden field values to your form using URL parameters or `data-field-fieldId` attribute (where `fieldId` has to be replaced with its real identifier).

Example using URL parameters for `code` field:

```
https://www.acme.com/?code=ABC123
```

Example using custom attribute for `code` field:

```html
<div data-arengu-form-id="YOUR_FORM_ID" data-field-code="ABC123"></div>
```

### **Method 2:** Calling our `embed` method

Our SDK has an embed method that allows to embed your form inside any element.

`embed` method definition:
```
ArenguForms.embed(formId, selector);
```
The `embed` call has the following fields:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| formId _(required)_| [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | The **Form ID** of your form. You can find it in your form settings or share page. |
| selector _(required)_ | [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)\|[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) | Query selector or DOM element that the form will be appended to. |
| customValues _(optional)_ | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)) | Object id-value pair to populate field or hidden field values. |

Example using the query selector:

```javascript
ArenguForms.embed('5073697614331904', '.form-container');
```

Example using the query selector and populated values:

```javascript
ArenguForms.embed('5073697614331904', '.form-container', {
  userId: '123456',
  email: 'jane.doe@arengu.com'
});
```

That snippet will embed the form with ID `5073697614331904` into the element with `.form-container` class.

Another example using the element directly:

```javascript
const container = document.querySelector('.form-container');
ArenguForms.embed('5073697614331904', container);
```

In this case, the snippet gets a reference to the element and passes it directly to the `embed()` method.
